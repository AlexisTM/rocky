a cat looks like nothing
  food is nowhere
  a cat takes milk
    let the food be milk
  (eom - constructor)
(eoc)
a tiger looks like a cat
  a tiger takes prey
    parent taking prey
  (eom - constructor)
(eoc)

Say "Parent constructor"
Kitty wants to be a cat taking "milk"
Tom wants to be a tiger taking "Jerry"
