Modulus takes Number and Divisor
Put Divisor into Big Divisor
While Big Divisor is less than Number
Put Big Divisor times 2 into Big Divisor
    (blank line ending While block)
While Big Divisor is as high as Divisor
If Number is as high as Big Divisor
Put Number minus Big Divisor into Number
    (blank line ending If block)
Put Big Divisor over 2 into Big Divisor
    (blank line ending While block)
Give back Number

N, D
BD = D
While BD < N
  BD = BD * 2
While BD >= D
  If N >= BD
     N = N - BD
  BD = BD / 2
Return N 

N=2, D=7
BD = 7
While 7 < 2
While 7 >= 7
  If 2 >= 7
  BD = 7 / 2  (3.5)
While 3.5 >= 7
