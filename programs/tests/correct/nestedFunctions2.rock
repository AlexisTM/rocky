Midnight takes your heart
Noon takes your love
Put your love into Sun
Give back your love
    (blank line terminating Noon)
Sun was nowhere
If your heart is greater than nothing
Put Noon taking your heart into your soul 
Put your heart minus one into Earth
Put Midnight taking Earth into Galaxy
Give back Galaxy plus Sun with your soul 
    (blank line terminating If)
Give back nothing
    (blank line terminating Midnight)
Shout Midnight taking 3
